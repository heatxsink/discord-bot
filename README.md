# discord-bot

I wanted to experiment controlling my "smart" lights at home with a chat bot interface.

Originally wanted to use Google Chat's bot for this task, sadly looks like it's not quite there yet.

I'm very impressed with the API that discord has created for bots, it's insanely well thought out.

Followed this tutorial <https://dev.to/aurelievache/learning-go-by-examples-part-4-create-a-bot-for-discord-in-go-43cf>.
